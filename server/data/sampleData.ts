Research scholarship opportunities systematicallyâ€”many go unclaimed each year due to lack of applicants. Open a local bank account to avoid foreign transaction fees, and investigate student banking packages which often include perks. Budget for health insurance, which may be mandatory for international students. Allow funds for travel and exploration, as experiencing the local culture is a valuable part of studying abroad. Create an emergency fund for unexpected expenses, ideally covering at least one month's living costs. Track your spending meticulously using budgeting apps to stay on track.

Consider temporary accommodation for your first few weeks if you prefer to search for permanent housing after arrival. Research neighborhoods thoroughly, considering factors like safety, proximity to campus, public transportation access, and available amenities. Be aware of common rental scams targeting international students, and never transfer money without verifying the legitimacy of the listing. Understand the terms of your lease fully before signing, including duration, payment terms, and break clauses. Budget realistically for all housing-related expenses, including utilities, internet, and security deposits.

Upon arrival, maintain an open mind and avoid quick judgments about cultural differences. Connect with other international students who can relate to your experiences, as well as local students who can provide cultural insights. Participate in orientation programs and cultural workshops offered by your institution. Develop a routine to create a sense of normalcy and stability in your new environment. Stay connected with family and friends from home, but balance this with immersion in your new setting. Take care of your physical and mental well-being through regular exercise, proper nutrition, and sufficient rest. Seek support from university counseling services if you experience persistent feelings of distress.

Begin language preparation as early as possible, ideally 6-12 months before your program starts. Immerse yourself in the language through films, podcasts, music, and news in your target language. Practice consistently rather than in intensive bursts, as regular exposure is more effective for language acquisition. Utilize language learning apps and online platforms that offer structured courses and interactive practice. Find a language exchange partner or conversation group to practice speaking in a low-pressure environment. Focus on academic vocabulary specific to your field of study, which often differs from conversational language. Attend pre-sessional language courses offered by many universities for international students. Don't be afraid to make mistakesâ€”they are an essential part of the learning process. During lectures, record (with permission) and review difficult content to improve comprehension. Seek help from university language support services, including writing centers and language tutors.
